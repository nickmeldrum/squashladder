# squashladder â€” the angularjs simple squash ladder app

Want to run a squash ladder? look no further!

To set up the application:

## Client side:
Read the Angular-Seed-README.md to set it up :-) but in short:

* Install the app once cloned: npm install
*  Run the webserver: npm start
* Then run the app: http://localhost:8000
* Run the js app tests: npm test
* Run the e2e client side tests: npm run protractor

## Server side:
Probably going to be a azure mobile services app for a simple REST based data store for the ladder...
